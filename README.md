## Corp Project

My first Next.js project deployed with vercel. Here I have used basic Next.js routing and reusable components with project folder structure.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
